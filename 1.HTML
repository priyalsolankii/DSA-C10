<!-- algorithm -->
1. initiate with making an input box and two buttons - "undo" and "redo" 2.we'll
make a function for this and onclick for this 3. whatever input is given we'll
split it into array such that we get seperate letters as we erase seperate
letters. 4. Upon on-click that one letter will pop and will get stored in new
empty array. 5. so similarly all five letters will get stored upon undo in an
array ( say - ankit) 6. Now on redo, the values which are stored in an array
will be taken as an input . 7. so basically while we are performing on-click
redo, we push the values, but now array will go in reverse order as the value
which was popped out last will now be pushed in first which is (array.length-1)
