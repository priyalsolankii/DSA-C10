<!-- question link (leetcode)-
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/ 

question- 
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the
array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth
distinct element. Can you solve it without sorting? -->

<!-- algo --
1. We have two special lists: one for counting positive numbers and one for counting negative numbers.

2. We go through the list of numbers one by one:

- If a number is positive, we look at our positive list. If the number is not there, we add it with a count of 1. If it's already there, we just increase its count.
- 3.If a number is negative, we look at our negative list. We actually consider the positive version of this number (ignore the minus sign) and do the same as above.
So far, we've counted how many times each number (positive or its positive version if negative) appears in the list.

4. Let's say we want to find the 5th largest number (k = 5).

We take all these counts from the positive and negative lists and put them together in a single list. Each position in this new list represents a number, and the value in that position represents how many times that number appears in the original list.

5.We start looking at the biggest numbers first (highest index in this new list) and move towards the smaller ones.

6.We keep subtracting the count of numbers we're looking at from the value of k (which started as the 5th largest number).

When we've subtracted enough counts to make k become zero or negative, we've found the kth largest number. We then say that the number at the current position (where we stopped) is the kth largest number. -->
