  //     question -

  //     The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

  // countAndSay(1) = "1"
  // countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
  // To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

  // For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":
  // Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

  //   algo -
  //   1- we'll start with the first digit and for each digit
  //     - we'll count how many times the same digit appears consecutively
  //     - write down the count followed by the digit
  //     - thn we'll move to the next set of different digits and repeat the counting process
  //     - we'll continue doing this until we've read and counted all the digits
  //   2- the result of above steps becomes the next term in the sequence
  //   3-  repeat above steps to generate the subsequent terms in the sequence

  //   Here's how the algorithm works: (from gpt)

  // The initial term is "1".
  // The first iteration generates "11" (one 1).
  // The second iteration generates "21" (two 1's).
  // The third iteration generates "1211" (one 2, one 1).
  // The fourth iteration generates "111221" (one 1, one 2, two 1's).
  // The fifth iteration generates "312211" (three 1's, two 2's, one 1).
  // The sixth iteration generates "131122311" (one 3, one 1, one 2, two 2's, three 1's).
